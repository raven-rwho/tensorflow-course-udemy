# NumPy
is mainly used to read and modify the values as NumPy arrays, because NumPy offers a lot different methods to 
fiddle with the around with the values

# Pandas
Maily used to read in the values from csv files. Normally you read in the values as a dataframe as
in Spark

# Perceptron
Is the mathmatical abstraction of a neuron - which consosts of several inputs (values) some weights (which are then multiplied)
an activation function (tanh, RelU, etc) and cost function which is used to determine the difference of the prediction
and the actual result to achieve some learning. The cost function is applied via backpropagation.
